# Modeling-of-10-bit-Pipeline-ADC-and-10-bit-DAC
This project shows how to model a 10-bit pipeline ADC and a 10-bit DAC using ideal components. Use vdc, vpulse, vcvs, switch, res, cap, vccs to construct the 10-bit ADC based on 1-bit per stage pipelined architecture. i Models are built in Cadence, &amp; Analysis is done on Matlab.
